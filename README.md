Optimisation problem benchmarking sets

This resource provides a list of optimisation problem benchmarking sets for evolutionary computation. The list is attached to the paper "Benchmarking in Optimization: Best Practice and Open Issues", see https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03488. It is maintained as a repository to facilitate regular updates.

1. *Artificial discrete optimization problems*.

    Subjectively, this area is among those with the largest number of benchmark sets. Here, many are inspired by problems encountered in the real world, which then have given rise to many fundamental problems in computer science. Noteworthy subareas of discrete optimization are combinatorial optimization, integer and constraint programming - and for many of them large sets of historically grown sets of benchmarks exist. Examples include the Boolean satisfiability and maximum satisfiability competitions (http://www.satcompetition.org/, https://maxsat-evaluations.github.io/), travelling salesperson problem library (http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/ and http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/index.html) and the mixed integer programming library (https://miplib.zib.de/).
